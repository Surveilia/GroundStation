At any time you can run the python script in "C:\Surveilia\Data". The script randomly generates data to be viewed in the chart.

the command is python dataGenerator.py, use the anaconda command line
if you don't have python available on your computer, install anaconda and you will be able to search for the anaconda terminal. Anaconda is the distribution.
